TODO list (not in order)
========================

	- Use dev managment resources allocation such as devm_kzalloc()

	- Support multiple screens by updating epddev into a linked list indexed
	  by the screen id (device minor number)

	- Get more info from platform data (EPD type, pwm channel id)

	- Try to speed up frame drawing

	- Is it better to have two char devices (one for control and one for
	  data). Or should I use ioctl()
		- ioctl pro :
			- Does not need to mux char driver based on minor
			  number
			- Are the standard in linux kernel
		- ioctl cons :
			- Need a .h to be exported
			- Cannot be used in shell script as-is
			- Cannot be used through network

	- Support pm suspend/resume

	- Support Pervasive Display COG G2 (EM027AS013).

	- Export spi commands specific code into a different file
